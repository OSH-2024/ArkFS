# Label Matching

This directory contains the code for the label matching experiments. An noteworthy thing is that it is just a prototype and is tremendously susceptible to all sorts of bugs and errors. The code is not optimized and is not meant to be used in production. It is just a proof of concept.

The latest version of searching is `search_type.py`, aiming to search for the best matching labels for a given label. The search is based on the similarity between the labels.
