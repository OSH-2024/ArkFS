The green grass is like a carpet, with fine leaves swaying gently in the breeze, and dappled sunlight casting patterns as if spreading a layer of green blanket over the earth. Each blade of grass is vibrant, full of life and vitality, with a fresh scent that brings a sense of peace and beauty of nature.
